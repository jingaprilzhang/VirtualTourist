#Virtual Tourist
Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree Project 4

Created an app that downloads and stores images from Flickr with Travel Location MapView and Photo Album View.

Designed to allow users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Tailored so that users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

Used NSURLSessions to interact with a public restful API and maintain media storage on the device file system. Polished in order for user interface to intuitively communicate network activity and download progress.
